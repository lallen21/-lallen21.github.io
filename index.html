      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="intro">My name is Logan Allen, and I have a variety of interests that keep me busy. Alongside my passion for track running, I enjoy unwinding with video games and anime during my downtime. Family is important to me, and I proudly consider myself a bit of a "momma's boy." Recently, I've taken up golf as a new hobby, aiming to improve my skills on the course. Additionally, I've developed an interest in web design, finding joy in exploring its creative possibilities. Whether I'm running on the track, gaming, practicing my swing, or diving into web projects, each pursuit adds its own flavor to my life's journey.</p>
